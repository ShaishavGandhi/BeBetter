# BeBetter

Repository of the Android application BeBetter, not yet published on PlayStore. BeBetter aims to be your personal productivity manager.

BeBetter *keeps track* of your mobile phone usage and warns you when you've exceeded your average etc.

1.01<sup>365</sup> = 37.8</br>
0.99<sup>365</sup> = 0.03

BeBetter believes that you should learn at least one new thing, fact, skill, trivia etc and log it just to keep track of all the things that you learn but forget.
That's why BeBetter encourages you to add *Lessons* that you learn everyday.
